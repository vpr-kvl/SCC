# SCC
SCC_Decision_errors

Here I suggest three different statistical methods you can use to assess whether it is justified to use a single general threshold such as 200 000 cells per mL cow milk or a linear score (SCS) for somatic cell counts (SCC). The methods can reveal five SCC categories that seem sufficient and necessary to capture the main components of a complicated SCC pattern. Substantial upward and downward changes in SCCs (outliers) can be explained as new cases or reductions of udder inflammation, respectively, and such pathobiologically different mechanisms may not fit a single linear scale such as SCS.
